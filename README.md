A C++ client–server application for uploading files to a server and downloading them.

The server allows configuring the storage path, allocated disk space, maximum upload size per user, and automatic cleanup of old files based on a specified lifetime and schedule.

The client provides a graphical interface to upload and download files from the server using unique ID.

The project is implemented in C++ using Asio for networking and wxWidgets for the graphical user interface.
